Parallel al64gori4thm23s are a class of algorithms that are designed to take advantage of the parallel processing capabilities of modern computer hardware These algorithms are used to solve problems that are too large or too complex to be solved by a single processor in a reasonable amount of time
There are several strategies that can be used to parallelize an algorithm including
Distributed Memory 56Parallelism This strategy involves dividing the problem into smaller sub problems that can be solved independently by different processors The processors communicate with each other to exchange information and combine the results
Shared Memory Parallelism This strategy involves using a single shared memory space to store the data and the results All processors access the shared memory to read and write data and results
Hybrid Parallelism This strate5gy combines both distributed memory parallelism and shared memory parallelism The problem is divided into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently by different processors and they share some memory space to exchange information
GPU Acceleration This strategy uses the massive parallel processing power of Graphics Processing Units GPUs to perform the computation in parallel
Task parallelism This strategy involves breaking down the problem into smaller tasks that can be executed in parallel
The choice of the parallel strategy depends on the nature of the problem and the hardware architecture
